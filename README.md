# React PWA starter

This project is the combination of `Enterwell React starter` with the [next-pwa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-pwa#configuration) plugin installed.

It serves as a starter to get the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) based PWA quickly running, while leveraging the nice-to-have architecture and structure behind the scenes.

For all the information about structure, architecture, naming and reasoning behind using the React starter visit the Enterwell React starter [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Enterwell/react-starter).

## Custom service worker

`next-pwa` plugin enables us to add custom service worker to the service worker generated by the [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) without any hassle with configuration. It automatically detects the root `worker` folder and the `index.js` or `index.ts` file inside of it where the worker is implemented. 

Then it bundles the file into `dest` (set inside the `next.config.js`) as `worker-*.js*` using `webpack`. 

For more information see the [next-pwa - custom worker example](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa/tree/master/examples/custom-worker).

## Offline support

When building the application in development mode using `yarn dev`, cache and precache are disabled. 
This means **offline support is disabled**, but you can continue developing other functions in service worker.

To be able to use caching and precaching, build and run the application in production mode using the following commands:

```
yarn build
```

```
yarn start
```
